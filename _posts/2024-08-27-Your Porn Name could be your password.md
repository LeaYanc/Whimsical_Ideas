# Your porn name could be your next password 

Password theft increases the number of passwords available for dictionary attacks. Although many people believe they have created infallible and untraceable passwords, such as

* uruguaycampeon
* RealMadrid@1
* NinoBravo
* Bumbury
* mallorca64
* asturiaspatriaquerida
* MaradonaD10S
* GazpachoAndaluz

All these examples are already included in the notorious Rockyou.txt, which is used by hackers and cybercriminals alike and contains almost all the most common passwords. You just have to search for it: (https://cybernews.com/password-leak-check/)

Out of sheer inertia, convenience, laziness or whatever you want to call it, humans are creatures of habit. We have all used the same passwords on different sites without giving them a second thought. Many people are unaware that even if their passwords are private and have never been shared with anyone, they may already be out there on the web, unknowingly giving access to the resources of the company they work for or their social networks.

The easiest thing to do is to recommend that people use a password manager to create and manage unique passwords for each site. But theory and practice are two very different things. At the moment, the use of password managers is something that less tech-savvy users have not yet internalised, unless they have been forced to do so. 

A good way to start raising awareness is to clearly explain that the more characters and the more complex a password is, the more time and resources it will take to crack it. And drawing attention to this is a great way to get people to adopt new concepts.

In training, we can teach people to create their own name as a porn actor/actress. It's very easy, just think of the name of your first pet and the street (or surname of the street) you lived on when you had that pet. From there you will come up with thousands of combinations, probably including names like :

* Tobi Del Prado
* Luna Castellana
* Kira Princesa
* Max Corrida
* Cocky Alcal√°

If we add uppercase, lowercase, special characters and some numbers to these names, we will generate longer and much more secure passwords (until they appear in the next Rockyou.txt). 

For the curious, my porn name should be 'Milky Garcia' and I haven't used it in a password yet.
